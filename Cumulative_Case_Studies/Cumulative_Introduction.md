# Cumulative Case Studies

These are Case Studies that have progressed through multiple files showcasing multiple skills. For example a PACE Strategy Document, which outlines the PACE Framework from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate. They use workplace scenarios with case study companies such as TikTok, Waze and a fictitious company called Automatidata. 

## PACE Framework

P ➡️ Plan

A ➡️ Analyse

C ➡️ Construct

E ➡️ Execute

Plan: You will define the scope of your project, you will begin by identifying the informational needs of your organisation. This is where you will ask yourself questions like the following:

* What are the goals of the project?
* What Startegies will be needed?
* What will be the business or operational impacts of this plan?

Analyse: You'll engage with the data, you'll start by preparing it for your project:

* Acquire the neccessary data from primary or secondary sources?
* Clean, Reoroganise and Transform Data for analysis?
* Methodological examination of the data
* Engage in EDA
* Work with your Stakeholders

Construct: You're going to persue a limited subset of all those potential insights that looked interesting to you in your EDA, and here is when you will work with other Data Professionals, potentially Stakeholders and Machine Learning Engineers to do things like:

* Build and revise Machine Learning Models
* Uncovering relationships in the data
* Apply statistical inferences about data relationships

Execute: You will share the results of your analysis and your collaboration with your stakeholders, as well as the value that you've unlocked from your data.
* Present findings to internal and external Stakeholders
* Answer Questions
* Consider differing viewpoints
* Present reccommendations based on the data.
