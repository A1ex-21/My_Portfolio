# Cumulative Case Studies

These are Case Studies that have progressed through multiple files showcasing multiple skills. They use workplace scenarios with case study companies such as TikTok, Waze and a fictitious company called Automatidata. 

For each part of the case study, there is a PACE Strategy Document, which outlines the PACE Framework from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate.

## PACE Framework

P ➡️ Plan

A ➡️ Analyse

C ➡️ Construct

E ➡️ Execute

Plan: You will define the scope of your project, you will begin by identifying the informational needs of your organisation. This is where you will ask yourself questions like the following:

* What are the goals of the project?
* What Startegies will be needed?
* What will be the business or operational impacts of this plan?

Analyse: You'll engage with the data, you'll start by preparing it for your project:

* Acquire the neccessary data from primary or secondary sources?
* Clean, Reoroganise and Transform Data for analysis?
* Methodological examination of the data
* Engage in EDA
* Work with your Stakeholders

Construct: You're going to persue a limited subset of all those potential insights that looked interesting to you in your EDA, and here is when you will work with other Data Professionals, potentially Stakeholders and Machine Learning Engineers to do things like:

* Build and revise Machine Learning Models
* Uncovering relationships in the data
* Apply statistical inferences about data relationships

Execute: You will share the results of your analysis and your collaboration with your stakeholders, as well as the value that you've unlocked from your data.
* Present findings to internal and external Stakeholders
* Answer Questions
* Consider differing viewpoints
* Present reccommendations based on the data.

**Project goal:**

Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze's business.

**Background:**

Waze's free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze's community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.

### Automatidata

**Project goal:**

In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

**Background:**

Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.
