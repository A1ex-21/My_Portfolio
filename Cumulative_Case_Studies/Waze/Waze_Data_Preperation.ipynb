    "\n",
    "1. Yes. The dataset contained 700 missing values, all of which occurred in the `label` variable (churned vs. retained). No other variables had missing data.\n",
    "2. The median is more robust to extreme outliers, which are present in the dataset. Therefore, using medians provides a more accurate representation of a typical user's behaviour, whereas means would be disproportionately influenced by a small number of very high-usage users.\n",
    "3. Yes, the analysis suggested that many churned users appear to be high intensity or \"super-drivers\" with fewer driving days but much longer distances and more drives per day. This thereby raises several follow up questions for the Waze team:\n",
    "    * Are these users professional or long-haul drivers?\n",
    "    * Does Waze adequately support the needs of high intensity users?\n",
    "    * Would segmenting users by driving intensity improve churn prediction and retention strategies?\n",
    "4. In the full dataset\n",
    "    * 64% of users were **iPhone**\n",
    "    * 36% of users were **Android**\n",
    "5. The key differences are:\n",
    "    * **Churned Users:**\n",
    "      * Drove more kilometers per month\n",
    "      * Had more drivers, but across fewer driving days\n",
    "      * Drove much farther per driving day\n",
    "      * Had significantly more drives per driving day\n",
    "    * **Retained Users:**\n",
    "      * Used the app on more days\n",
    "      * Had shorter, less intense trips\n",
    "      * Drove slightly more kilometers per drive, but far less per driving day\n",
    "  \n",
    "    This therefore suggests that churned users tend to exhibit high intensity, concentrated usage patterns while the retained users show more regular, distributed engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. There was no difference in the churn rate with the device mix being nearly identical between churned and retained users:\n",
    "   * Churned Users: **65% iPhone**, **35% Android**\n",
    "   * Retained Users: **64% iPhone**, **36% Android**\n",
    "  \n",
    "    This therefore indicates that the device type is not a meaningful driver of user churn in this dataset."
