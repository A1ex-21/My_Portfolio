    "1. I am being asked to prepare the data for modelling, compute feature engineering and to build two tree-based models and evaluate their performance to classify whether a user will churn or be retained.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The consequence of the model making an error is that a user could leave the app and have no preventable actions taken. The effect that the model will have when it predicts a false negative is that a user will leave Waze and Waze will fail to take proactive measures in order to retain users who are likely to stop using the app. These measures might be to push an application notification to users or to send a user survey to better understand their dissatisfaction. The effect a model has when making a false positive is that the user who will still stay with Waze but will have the proactive measures in place still, which can lead to an annoying or negative experience for the loyal users of Waze.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Yes, the benefits outweigh the risks as it will lead to more users being with Waze for their journeys. The proactive measures by Waze may have unintended effects on the users which in turn may enhance user churn. Therefore, a follow up analysis on the effectiveness of the proactive measures is highly recommended and if they are reasonable and effective then again yes, the benefits do outweigh the risks.\n",
    "\n",

    "The XGBoost model made more use of many of the features than did the logistic regression model from the previous course, which weighted a single feature (`activity_days`) very heavily in its final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "If anything, this underscores the importance of feature engineering. Notice that engineered features accounted for six of the top 10 features (and three of the top five). Feature engineering is often one of the best and easiest ways to boost model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the important features in one model might not be the same as the important features in another model. That's why you shouldn't discount features as unimportant without thoroughly examining them and understanding their relationship with the dependent variable, if possible. These discrepancies between features selected by models are typically caused by complex feature interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion.\n",

Consider the following questions as you prepare to write your executive summary.

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is dependent upon what the model is being used for, if the model is being used for the main business objective to predict user churn and to drive consequential business decisions, then no as it is not suitable as a predictor as made clear by the many false negatives and missclassifications. In constrast, if this model is to be used for exploratory purposes, then yes as it can help develop further insight and improved modelling that may achieve the final objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The tradeoff was that by splitting the data into 3 ways there is in turn less data for the model to be trained on compared with just splitting the data two ways. In return, when performing model selection on a seperate validation set, this enables for the chosen champion model to be tested again on the test set which gives a better estimate of the models future performance on unseen data. This better estimate of the models future performance and certainty is much better than the estimated model performance from splitting the data two ways and performing model selection of a champion model on the test set. Therefore, the tradeoff is that although you get less data to train the model with in turn you get to see how the model reacts to unseen test data and you get a better estimate of the champion models performance on unseen test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The benefit of logistic regression models over ensemble tree-based models for classification tasks is that they are easier to interpret. This is due to the logistic regression model assigning coefficients to the predictor variables which reveals not only which variables factored the most heavily into the models final predictions but also the directionality of the weight. This means that they reveal whether the variable is positively or negatively correlated with the target variable in the final models predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The benefit of using a ensemble tree-based model over a logistic regression model is that the tree-based models are often better predictors. Thereby if the most important objective of the project is predictive power of the model, then the tree-based models will usually out perform the logistic regression model, but this is not always the case. Tree-based models also require less data cleaning and have fewer assumptions about the underlying distributions of the variables, hence making them easy to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To improve the models performance new features could be engineered in order to try to generate a better predictive signal as is often the case if you have domain knowledge. In regards to this model, the features that were already engineered for this model made up over half of the top 10 most predictive features for the model. It can also be usefull to reconstruct the model with different combinations of predictor variables in order to reduce the noise from unpredictive features.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The additional features I would have in order to improve the model is drive level information for each user via drive times, geographic locations, etc. It can also be helpful to have more granular data to know how the users interact with the app such as if they report road hazards or roadworks. Finally, it can be usefull to know the monthly count of unique starting and ending locations of each drivers inputs for their journeys."
