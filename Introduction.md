# **My Portfolio**
![My Portfolio Econometrics and R](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4894ec7-b24f-42ce-aba5-e2ab664cca43)

Hello and welcome to my portfolio, here I will showcase my skills and proficiency in programming and Data Analytics.

## Guide for the Portfolio

* **Case Studies**

These are case studies that are not cumulative and therefore are a single file containing the case study, showcasing Data Analytical skills.

An example of one is "How does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?", this was part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate and follows the Data Analysis process from the Certificate.

* **Cumulative Case Studies**

These are Case Studies that follow a continuos progression of files and showcase alot more skills, such as technical and communication skills. These come from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, and at the end of each Course a project is done to add to the portfolio, where it showcases the skills learned in that Course. These Case Studies come with a Project Overview, stating the scenario, the background and the criteria for that Project in the Certificate. They also come with a PACE Strategy Document which follows the PACE Framework (Plan, Analyse, Construct, Execute) Check the Cumulative_Case_Studies folder for more. The Certificate offers a workplace scenario to be chosen for the Projects, TikTok, Waze and Automatidata, in which all the names of the team members are fictional.

The contents in each Cumulative Case Study folder will be of the project deliverables, Project Data folders, Project Overview folder, PACE Strategy Document Folder and any output folders (if applicable).

* **Kaggle Competitions**

This is where I showcase the work I have done for Kaggle Competitions, these competitions are a great way to have fun, learn and showcase skills.


* **Format**

  * All Documents that contain code will be in markdown format as this is fits well with Github and is a great way for showcasing code. There might be some cases where documents are uploaded in its original format, such as rmd and ipynb, which can be downloaded to view.

  * All Microsoft Word documents will be in PDF format.

  * All Excel Files will be in .CSV format.

  * All Images will be in png format.

## **My Background**

My name is Alexander, and I am a recent graduate with a BSc in Economics. I have a strong passion for continuous learning and enjoy exploring how new knowledge can be applied in practical, meaningful ways. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I independently taught myself Forex and commodities trading, which introduced me to the dynamic nature of financial markets. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for problem-solving and skill development, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Economics.

Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in economic theory, econometrics, and statistical analysis. I gained proficiency in various statistical software packages, and I completed the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate, which enhanced my understanding of financial markets and allowed me to confidently navigate the Bloomberg Terminal.

Following graduation, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I acquired key skills in data analysis, including SQL and R. My final project involved a comprehensive case study, applying these tools to derive actionable insights. I initially learned SQL using the BigQuery dialect and later expanded my knowledge to include SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). I also integrated RStudio with my database and continued to build on my R skills through participation in a Kaggle competition, where I used the XGBoost model to predict insurance premiums. Additionally, I‚Äôve learned how to access, analyze, and visualize data from sources such as Eurostat and FRED using R.

Currently, I am pursuing the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, which focuses on a new analytical framework, Python programming, advanced statistics, and machine learning. I am excited to deepen my expertise in these areas and apply them to future data-driven challenges.
