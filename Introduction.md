Hello and welcome to my portfolio, here I will showcase my skills and proficiency in programming and Data Analytics.

## **My Background**

My name is Alexander, and I am a recent graduate with a BSc in Economics. I have a strong passion for continuous learning and enjoy exploring how new knowledge can be applied in practical, meaningful ways. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I independently taught myself Forex and commodities trading, which introduced me to the dynamic nature of financial markets. This experience sparked my enthusiasm for problem-solving and skill development, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Economics.

Throughout my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in economic theory, econometrics, and statistical analysis. I gained proficiency in various statistical software packages, and I completed the Bloomberg Market Concepts Certificate, which enhanced my understanding of financial markets and allowed me to confidently navigate the Bloomberg Terminal.

Following graduation, I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics Certificate, where I acquired key skills in data analysis, including SQL and R. My final project involved a comprehensive case study, applying these tools to derive actionable insights. I initially learned SQL using the BigQuery dialect and later expanded my knowledge to include SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). I also integrated RStudio with my database and continued to build on my R skills through participation in a Kaggle competition, where I used the XGBoost model to predict insurance premiums. Additionally, I‚Äôve learned how to access, analyze, and visualize data from sources such as Eurostat and FRED using R.

Currently, I am pursuing the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, which focuses on a new analytical framework, Python programming, advanced statistics, and machine learning. I am excited to deepen my expertise in these areas and apply them to future data-driven challenges.
