Hello and welcome to my portfolio, here I will showcase my skills and proficiency in programming and Data Analytics.

## Guide for the Portfolio

* **Case Studies**

These are case studies that are not cumulative and therefore are a single file containing the case study, showcasing Data Analytical skills.

An example of one is "How does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?", this was part of my Google Data Analytics Certificate and follows the Data Analysis process from the Certificate.

* **Cumulative Case Studies**

These are Case Studies that follow a continuos progression of files and showcase alot more skills, such as technical and communication skills. These come from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, and at the end of each Course a project is done to add to the portfolio, where it showcases the skills learned in that Course. These Case Studies come with a Project Overview, stating the scenario, the background and the criteria for that Project in the Certificate. They also come with a PACE Strategy Document which follows the PACE Framework (Plan, Analyse, Construct, Execute) Check the Cumulative_Case_Studies folder for more. The Certificate offers a workplace scenario to be chosen for the Projects, TikTok, Waze and Automatidata, in which all the names of the team members are fictional.

The contents in each Cumulative Case Study folder will be of the project deliverables, Project Data folders, Project Overview folder, PACE Strategy Document Folder and any output folders (if applicable).

* **Kaggle Competitions**

This is where I showcase the work I have done for Kaggle Competitions, these competitions are a great way to have fun, learn and showcase skills.


* **Format**

  * All Documents that contain code will be in markdown format as this is fits well with Github and is a great way for showcasing code. There might be some cases where documents are uploaded in its original format, such as rmd and ipynb, which can be downloaded to view.

  * All Microsoft Word documents will be in PDF format.

  * All Excel Files will be in .CSV format.

  * All Images will be in png format.
