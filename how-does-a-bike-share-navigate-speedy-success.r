The director of marketing Lily Moreno, believes that annual members are more profitable than casual riders and sees an opportunity to convert existing casual riders into annual members rather than focusing on acquiring new customers.\n","\n","To support this initiative, I will analyse Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. These insights will help the team design targeted marketing strategies to encourage casual riders to purchase annual memberships. But first, the Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n","\n","###**Characters and Teams**\n","\n","*Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can't use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.\n","\n","*Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n","\n","*Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic's mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n","\n","*Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n","\n","###**About the company**\n","\n","In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n","\n","Until now, Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.\n","Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n","\n","Cyclistic's finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.\n","\n","Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n","\n","#**Ask**\n","\n","##*What is the problem you are trying to solve?*\n","\n","##*How can your insights drive business decisions?*\n","\n","The problem to solve is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic Bikes differently.

So the goal of Cyclistic is to maximise the number of annual memberships.\n","\n","My insights can drive business decisions as it will identify the usage patterns of both causal riders and annual members therefore highlighting the differences in trip length, frequency and purpose. The insights from the analysis can provide actionable data to tailor marketing campaigns on focusing on the motivations and behaviours of casual riders. It will also guide the resource allocation for promotional activities on digital media to therefore influence casual riders to become annual members, thereby aligning with Cyclistic’s business goals. \n","\n","**Business Task**:Analyse and interpret Cyclistic’s Historical bike trip data to understand the behavioural differences between annual members and causal riders.

The highest ride counts occur during the weekdays, reflecting potential commuting behaviour. Casual riders, contribute far fewer rides compared to members, but their usage increases on weekends. This suggests that causal riders predominantly use the service for leisure or recreational purposes on non-working days.\n","\n","The insights gained from the analysis directly supports Cyclistic’s goal of converting casual riders into annual members. Causal riders primarily use bikes for leisure activities on weekends and tend to have longer ride duration's. In contrast, annual members use bikes for short, frequent trips, particularly on weekdays which likely aligns with commuting purposes. The distinct difference in behaviour highlights an opportunity for Cyclistic to promote the value of annual memberships by emphasising the benefits such as convenience, cost savings and suitability for frequent, shorter trips.\n","\n","Due to the fact that casual riders’ usage peaks during the weekends, Cyclistic can design targeted campaigns for this time frame, thereby showcasing the advantages of switching to annual memberships. Marketing strategies could include discounts for first-time memberships, referral bonuses or seasonal promotions aimed at encouraging casual riders to take advantage of cost savings and unlimited rides. By aligning campaigns with peak usage times, Cyclistic can effectively capture the attention of casual riders when they are most likely to engage with the service.\n","\n","In addition, causal riders longer ride duration's suggest they value the experience of cycling, whether for leisure or exploration. This behaviour can be leveraged in marketing messaging by highlighting the flexibility and freedom that comes with annual memberships, thereby allowing riders to explore and enjoy the city without worrying about per-ride costs. Combining this messaging with digital media campaigns can help communicate the value of memberships in both recreational and practical use cases. \n","\n","In Conclusion, these insights help Cyclistic design data driven marketing strategies that appeal to casual riders unique behaviours and motivations. By emphasising cost-effectiveness, flexibility and convenience, Cyclistic can increase the likelihood of converting casual users into annual members, thereby ultimately driving higher profitability and customer retention.\n","\n","#**Share**\n","\n","The data tells a story of two distinct user groups: casual riders who have longer average ride duration with higher usage on weekends, and annual members who have shorter, frequent rides throughout the week, peaking on weekdays. This highlights that casual riders are leisure focused, while annual members are consistent, frequent users likely leveraging the service for daily commutes.\n","\n","The findings address the question of how casual riders and annual members use bikes differently. Understanding these patterns provides a foundation for designing targeted marketing campaigns to convert casual riders into annual members. The audience of this study includes Cyclistic’s executive team and marketing analysts. To effectively communicate the findings a combination of data visualisations and a clear, concise summary of insights will be used. Charts created with ggplot2 clearly illustrate the differences in ride duration, frequency and usage patterns between the two groups.\n","\n","Data visualisations are essential for clearly communicating trends and insights. Bar charts showing the average ride duration and the number of rides by weekday help the stakeholders quickly grasp the key behavioural differences between casual riders and annual members. The presentation would be accessible to the audience as it will feature clean, professional visuals, clear labels and a brief narrative explaining the findings and their implications. Supporting data and summaries will be included in an accessible format such as slides, PDF report or a dashboard.\n","\n","##**Data Visualisations**\n","\n","###**Number of Rides by Weekday**\n","\n","```{r Number of Rides by Weekday}\n","all_trips_v2 %>% \n","  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at,label = TRUE)) %>% \n","  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% \n","  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% \n","  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>% \n","  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = number_of_rides, fill = member_casual)) + \n","  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") + labs(title = \"Number of Rides by Weekday\", fontface = \"bold\", subtitle = \"Casual Riders vs. Annual Members\", caption = \"Made using 2019_Q1 and 2020_Q1 Data\")\n","```\n","\n","###**Average Ride Duration for each Rider Type**\n","\n","```{r Average Ride Duration for each Rider Type}\n","all_trips_v2 %>% \n","  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at, label = TRUE)) %>% \n","  group_by(member_casual, weekday) %>% \n","  summarise(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length)) %>% \n","  arrange(member_casual, weekday) %>% \n","  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = average_duration, fill = member_casual)) + \n","  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") + labs(title = \"Average Ride Duration for each Rider Type\", subtitle = \"Casual Riders vs. Annual Members\", caption = \"Made using 2019_Q1 and 2020_Q1 Data\")\n","```\n","\n","##**Presentation**\n","\n","To view my presentation click [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_TtCAj7LnrqlN8IK_eXAM33pKqr4IB8s/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104952222776858457522&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n","\n","#**Act**\n","\n","The analysis highlights that casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Casual riders tend to use the bikes for longer duration's, primarily on weekends, which suggests a preference for leisure and recreational activities. In contrast, annual members use the bikes for shorter, frequent rides throughout the weekdays, indicating routine commuting behaviour. To convert casual riders into annual members, Cyclistic should emphasise the cost-effectiveness, convenience and flexibility of annual memberships while tailoring marketing to align with casual riders habits.\n","\n","The marketing team can apply these insights via designing targeted campaigns and promotional offer. For example, focusing on weekends with specific promotions for leisure riders, creating cost comparisons to highlight the savings of an annual membership and offering seasonal discounts or event based incentives. These strategies directly address the behaviours and motivations identified in the analysis, making the marketing initiatives more effective.\n","\n","The next steps would involve implementing and testing these strategies to measure their impact. Cyclistic should roll out targeted campaigns, introduce limited time offers like seasonal discounts or free trials, and then monitor key performance indicators such as membership sign ups, conversion rates and changes in casual rider behaviour. By tracking these metrics, the team can evaluate the effectiveness of the campaigns and would be able to refine the strategies as needed in order to optimise the results.\n","\n","In order to expand on these findings, additional data could provide a deeper understanding of user behaviours and preferences. For example, demographic data such as age, location or occupation, could help tailor the marketing messages to specific user segments. Long term seasonality trends from multiple years would offer more predictive insights for peak usage times. In addition, conducting customer surveys would allow for Cyclistic to gather direct feedback from casual riders to understand their barriers to purchasing memberships and identify which benefits they value the most.\n","\n","By consolidating these insights into a final presentation or report, Cyclistic can confidently move forward with data-driven strategies in order to increase annual memberships. This process ensures that the findings are actionable, measurable and aligned with the company’s goals of profitability and growth.\n","\n","#**References**\n","\n","## Data Sources\n","\n","1.
